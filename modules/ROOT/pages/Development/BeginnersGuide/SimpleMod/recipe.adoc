= Recipe vs Schematic

Before we create our first recipe,
it's important to note the difference between
a 'recipe' and a 'schematic.'

In Satisfactory, 'Recipes' are used to define the item input/cost
and output of crafting items, buildables, etc.
Recipes are not only used for the craft bench or the workshop,
but also for the build gun, smelters, manufacturers and more.
You can read more about recipes on the xref:Development/Satisfactory/Crafting.adoc[Crafting page].

[TIP]
====
Note that recipes are used to define both crafting recipes in the craft bench and machines _and_ construction prices when using the build gun.
All buildables actually have an item equivalent in game as well.
====

'Schematics', on the other hand, define things like  https://satisfactory.gamepedia.com/Milestones[Milestones], the shipments submitted to FICSIT via the HUB in order to unlock new recipes and features. This is far from their only feature.
You can read more about schematics on the xref:Development/Satisfactory/Schematic.adoc[Schematic page].

== Create a Recipe

First of all, we want to add a recipe to the game which will get unlocked with the schematic we will create afterwards. We're going to make some new leaf based recipes to start.
Create a folder, `+DocMod Content/Recipes+` which will contain all our recipes.

Now in Unreal, we need to create a new Blueprint Class in this folder which extends xref::/Development/Satisfactory/Crafting.adoc#_recipes_fgrecipe[FGRecipe] to serve as our recipe. Call it something like Recipe_Doc to follow Coffee Stain's naming pattern.

Finally, we can define the recipe description itself. Open up the class and go to the class defaults and set the properties to the values you want.

* {blank}
+
M Display Name::
  If you want to define a name for your recipe, check this and type the name in.
  For our tutorial recipe, we'll check it and call it "Doc Recipe".
  This name will show up inside the manual crafting bench or any machines you set this recipe to be used in.
* {blank}
+
M Ingredients::
  This is an array of structs, each of which contains the information of one crafting component. Together, the array forms the input items for the recipe.
  For this example, we'll add one entry and set `Desc_Leaves` as the `Item Class` and 42 as the `Amount`.
* {blank}
+
M Manufacturing Duration::
  This determines the time it takes for a machine to process this recipe in seconds.
  We'll set it to 1 for now, because we are super speedy pioneers. 
* {blank}
+
M Manual Manufacturing Multiplier::
  If you want to use the same recipe for machines and the craft bench, with this value you can define how much longer the crafting of this recipe should take longer in the craft bench. 
  Because we don't have time, we set this to 0.
  With the multiplier set to the default of 0, the number of clicks to craft is the number of seconds it takes to craft divided by two.
* {blank}
+
M Produced In::
  Here we need to select the machine that can use the recipe, for example, `+FGWorkBench+`.
* {blank}
+
M Product::
  This is another an array of structs that defines the item types and amounts that form the output of the recipe.
  In our case we'll add an entry with `Desc_Wood` as the `+Item Class+` and 1 as the `Amount`.
  While you can create recipes with multiple outputs, the machine needs to have the correct number and type of output ports for this to work.

Ok, now you've created your first recipe! Next, let's add it to a schematic to make it available in game.

== Create a Schematic

Schematics are what Satisfactory uses to grant recipes and capabilities to the player. Schematics are the milestones you'll see in the HUB, the Tier 0 tutorial phases, M.A.M researches, alternate recipe researches, and more. If the player is unlocking an item, building, or any recipe it's probably be granted by a schematic.

To get started, create a folder in your main mod folder for your schematics, for example, `+DocMod Content/Schematics+`. Inside this folder create again a new BP Class but this time of type xref::/Development/Satisfactory/Schematic.adoc[FGSchematic] and f.e. with the name "Schem_Doc". Open it and go again to its defaults.

* {blank}
+
M Type::
  The type of the schematic, which determines if it's part of the tutorial system or if it's a Milestone/etc.
  We'll use `Milestone`.
* {blank}
+
M Display Name::
  The in-game name of our schematic exactly as it is displayed to the user.
  We'll use "Doc Plants Upgrade".
* {blank}
+
M Schematic Category::
  Defines the category in which this schematic gets grouped into.
  Go ahead and pick one, it doesn't matter for our example.
* {blank}
+
M Sub Category::
  Defines in which sub group the schematic should get categorized.
  We leave this array empty.
* {blank}
+
M Tech Tier::
  Determines which Tier the schematic will appear under in the HUB.
  We'll set it to 1 so that our content is available as soon as you finish the tutorial.
* {blank}
+
M Time to Complete::
  Remember that annoying time when you purchased a milestone and the space ship leaves, blocking you from buying other milestones, or waiting for research to complete?
  We will set it to 60 seconds. For milestones, if this value is shorter than the time it takes for the pod animation to launch, it will visually bug out, but you will still be able to submit milestones without issue.
* {blank}
+
M Schematic Icon::
  The icon displayed on a HUB milestone or M.A.M. Research.
  We can use link:{attachmentsdir}/BeginnersGuide/simpleMod/Icon_SchemDoc.png[this example image]. 
  You should make another folder (say `Content/DocMod/Icons`) to hold your mod's icon files.
  You can import the image into your project by navigating to your destination folder in the Unity Editor Content Browser and then dragging and dropping the file from a File Explorer window.
  Once the image has been imported successfully, it can be selected as M Schematic Icon using the drop-down menu.
* {blank}
+
M Cost::
  A list of items and the amounts needed to purchase the schematic in the HUB.
  We'll add two entries, one with 100 `+Desc_Leaves+` and another one with 50 `+Desc_Wood+`
* {blank}
+
M Unlocks::
  This array contains the rewards the player will get when purchasing this schematic. It's an array of xref::/Development/Satisfactory/Schematic.adoc#_fgunlock_ufgunlock[FGUnlock]s. The different kinds of unlocks are discussed in the schematics page.
  What we'll add to this array is a `BP Unlock Recipe`. In its properties we can then add recipes, such as the one we made earlier.
* {blank}
+
M Schematic Dependencies::
  This array allows for a schematic's purchase to be locked depending upon other schematics or items in the world.
  We'll leave this empty because we don't want our content to require any other particular schematic to be unlocked first.
* {blank}
+
M Include In Builds::
  Set this to 'PublicBuilds' so that your content is included in the build.
  Presumably, this is what Coffee Stain uses to keep their developer milestones made for testing from being shipped with the main game.

Finally! What a class. Now we just need to register this schematic so it shows up at runtime.

== Register the Schematic

To register the schematic we can use our recently created xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/SimpleMod/gameworldmodule.adoc#_create_the_class[InitGameWorld] and add the schematics to the `M Schematics` array of the InitGameWorld. Double click on InitGameWorld to edit it and add your schematic to the `M Schematics` array.

And we're set! Our recipe and schematic are registered and should show up in the game now. To test it out, go ahead and run Alpakit and launch the game. The main menu should now show a higher loaded mods count, and you should be able to buy and test your schematic and recipes in game.
